Chess Data API
==============

This project is intended to store data that comes from chess tournaments. This is mainly for personal use, but feel free
to either contribute or use. Eventually I plan to make a frontend for this, but currently I am not sure how I would achieve
this.

Also if you have a better project name, let me know.
